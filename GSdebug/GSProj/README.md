the output of the &variable ran into the preceeding tab writing over the 0 at cout making it look like a memory location hex value starting with a hebrew letter signifying the letter was of low-level memory (root). 
the letter name variables are constructed of c-structed short integers making atoi complete.
subsequent values (not location hex value) are appended to this location as their PATH. (Each value represents a different "level of encoding").

- the core instantiates a dedicated scalable partition mapping the selected key values to memory
- the core accesses its space on the chip
- create methods of scaling the size and location of the matrix according to user input (to access and examine memory locations - debugger)

- finish chord locations for wrapping to start and extending past fret 12 so they expand and roll with the scaling - and so as to move the SCOPE of the frame (migration) post instantiation. 

-The goal is to create a fully mobile virtual machine capable of being re-scaled, and re-designed, that can run on any chip architecture parallel to the existing operating systems. The ability to examine the memory throughout the host system - add GDB-style debugging capabilities and set installation default to root settings. (The system has already accepted by allowing the software to be introduced to the machine. The Platform is meant to run independently of the current system on the machine, but be capable of accessing the members and data of the other programs operating within the root domain i.e. the machine's assembly-level framework.-- point to memory locations of operating system's main variables --
